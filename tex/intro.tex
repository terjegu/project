One of the earliest implementations of speech conversion utilised vector quantisation \cite{abe88} with discrete source and target classes. In contrast the Gaussian mixture model, GMM\abbrev{GMM}{Gaussian Mixture Model}, method \cite{stylianou98} which uses continuous probability density mapping.

\label{sec:definition}
Speech transformation is the process of modifying the speech signal from one speaker so that it sounds like it has been pronounced by a different speaker \cite{stylianou98}.

\label{sec:synthesis_methods}
Speech modification can be classified into three categories \cite{nguyen09}.
\begin{description}
	\item[Time-scale modification: ] The process of altering the duration of the speech signal without modifying the pitch and other qualities.
	\item[Pitch-scale modification: ] The goal of pitch modification is to change the fundamental frequency while maintaining the speed and spectral properties of the speech signal.
	\item[Spectral modification: ] Spectral modification alters the spectral attributes without modifying the duration and spectral properties.
